Build a mobile-first progressive web application called "Deeper" — a Christian dating conversation card app with swipeable question cards and an admin CMS.

## TECH STACK
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or lightweight framework)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: SQLite (simple) or PostgreSQL
